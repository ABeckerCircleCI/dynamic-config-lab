    Test splitting allows you to distribute your tests across multiple containers, reducing the overall time it takes to run your tests. By the end of this challenge, you'll have a more efficient pipeline with reduced test runtime, making your development process faster and more efficient.

Your next task is to leverage the power of CircleCI's test splitting feature to reduce the run time of your tests. You will create a new job, `test-split-by-filename`, that runs tests in parallel, splitting them by file names.

Task 1: Create a new job
==============
1. Create a new [job](https://circleci.com/docs/jobs-steps/#jobs-overview) named `test-split-by-filename`.
1. Use the same Docker image as the `test` job (`cimg/go:1.21`).

Task 2: Set parallelism and attach workspace.
==============
1. Configure the `test-split-by-filename` job to run in [parallel](https://circleci.com/docs/parallelism-faster-jobs/) across multiple containers by setting the `parallelism` key to `2` in the job configuration.
1. Add a step to attach the [workspace](https://circleci.com/docs/workflows/) at `~/` in the `test-split-by-filename` job configuration.

Task 3: Split tests
==============
1. Add an empty `run:` step to your new job which we'll use to run our tests, split by filename, as detailed below.
1. Use the [`circleci tests glob`](https://circleci.com/docs/use-the-circleci-cli-to-split-tests/#glob-test-files) command within this step to find all Go test files (`*_test.go`) within this step.
1. Pipe the result into [`circleci tests split`](https://circleci.com/docs/use-the-circleci-cli-to-split-tests/#split-tests) and store the output in a variable named `TESTS`.
1. Run the `gotestsum` command as before, this time providing the `$TESTS` variable as a final argument.

The final command should look like:
  ```
  TESTS=$(circleci tests glob *_test.go | circleci tests split)
  gotestsum --junitfile report.xml $TESTS
  ```
> **Note:** The CLI knows which particular machine it is running on via the environment variables `CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX` and `CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL`.

Task 4: Store test results and artifacts
==============
1. Add steps to store the [test results](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#storetestresults) and the `report.xml` file as an artifact in the `test-split-by-filename` job configuration.

Task 5: Add to the workflow
==============
1. Include the `test-split-by-filename` job in the `build-test-deploy` workflow.
1. Set the `test-split-by-filename` job to require the completion of the `install-dependencies` job before running.

Task 6: Observe the results
==============
1. Push your changes to the repository.
1. Compare the runtime of the `test` and `test-split-by-filename` jobs in the pipeline.
1. Observe the `CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX` and `CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL` environment variables in the "Preparing environment variables" step in the CircleCI UI.
